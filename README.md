# BertiniReal in Julia

This package is part of my undergraduate thesis project in Systems and Computer Engineering, where my goal is to implement [Bertini Real](https://www.bertinireal.com/) in Julia. This package is inspired by [HomotopyContinuation.jl](https://www.juliahomotopycontinuation.org/).

## About Me
I am Juan Camilo Gonzalez, a recent graduate in Mathematics. I am passionate about computational algebra and a Julia enthusiast.
